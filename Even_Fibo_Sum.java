Given a number N find the sum of all the even valued terms in the Fibonacci sequence less than or equal to N.
The first few terms of Fibonacci Numbers are, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, 233 ,â€¦ (Even numbers are highlighted).
 

Sample test Case:
Input:
N = 8
Output:
10

Explanation:
There are two even 
fibonacci numbers less
than equal to 8, 8 and 2 
and 8 + 2 = 10
